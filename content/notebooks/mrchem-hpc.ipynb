    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this exercise you will use the MRChem code to compute NMR shielding constants and magnetizibilities for a Ni(CO)_3 complex bound to an N-Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) ligand. \n",
    "NHCs are commonly used in organometallic chemistry, and are often involved in catalytic cycles.\n",
    "They contain a zero-valent carbon atom that acts as a very strong sigma-donor, which often coordinates to a transition metal.\n",
    "Due to the bulky nature of many NHCs, they are used to help stabilize reactive or exotic chemical species.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NHC used here is depicted in the image below. One usually tunes the NHC by substituing the methyl groups with larger and more bulky side groups.\n",

    "## How to run the calculation\n",
    "Due to the size of the system, we need to run this calculation on one of the national HPC clusters. The instructions here are specific to `Saga`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a submit script where we set up the calculation, since we are submitting to the `SLURM` queueing manager. We will be using MRChem in a hybrid OpenMP+MPI parallelization mode, which ensures very good scaling on HPC clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "We provide a convenience script that you can copy to the cluster (`runMRChem.sh`), to use for setting up the SLURM variables, loading MRChem, and copying files to/from the scratch directory.\n",
    "Here is the usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
